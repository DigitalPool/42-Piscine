# üåä 42 Piscine ‚Äì Dive into the Code Ocean! üåä

Welcome to my **42 Piscine Journey**! This repository documents my progress through the challenging and immersive world of the Piscine. The 42 coding bootcamp is where I learned the basics of programming through intense practice in C and Unix systems. Here‚Äôs everything you‚Äôll need to stay afloat, with project summaries.

> **Quick Tip**: Don‚Äôt just copy ‚Äì **learn** it, live it, and embrace the code!

## üèÑ Weekly Piscine Breakdown ‚Äì Stay Ahead of the Waves! üåä

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of weekly tasks to keep you organized, productive, and prepared for the exams:

### **Week 1**: The Essentials üß©
> **Projects**: Shell00, Shell01, C00, C01  
> **Tip**: Focus on **C** projects, especially **C00** and **C01** since exams emphasize C programming. Shell projects? Tackle them over the weekend.

---

### **Week 2**: Strengthening Foundations üèóÔ∏è
> **Projects**: C02, C03, C04, C06  
> **Tip**: Finish **C06** before **C05** since Exam01 focuses on `argc` and `argv`.

1. **Log In** with `exam / exam`.
2. **Initialize** with `kinit username` and enter your password.
3. Type `examshell` to start the exam environment.

**Remember** to:
- Clean up, remove test code, and push frequently to `rendu/` on Vogsphere.
- Type `grademe` + `y` to submit.

| Exam Preparation | Knowledge Required |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Exam 00**      | Functions, Loops, Conditionals, Arrays, Strings |
| **Exam 01 / 02** | `argc`, `argv`, `malloc`, `free`                |
